## Hiya! ðŸ‘‹

I am a data professional based in London, UK. I love exploring and visualizing data, but also using technology to build software. I am currently looking for new opportunities, ideally a position of an analytics engineer or data analyst with fair use of technology (i.e. not only Excel and/or dashboards, but also some R/Python please).

To be fair, you won't find much in my GitHub repos at the moment because vast majority of my work has been proprietary and not public. But I'll be filling the space here with some personal projects.
