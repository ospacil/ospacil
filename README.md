## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a data professional based in London, UK. I love analysing and visualizing data and using technology to build software or other tools. I am currently looking for new opportunities in data analytics or analytics engineering space. Please feel free to connect on LinkedIn ([in/ospacil/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ospacil/)) or Bluesky ([ospacil.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/ospacil.bsky.social)).

To be sincere, you won't find much in my public GitHub repositories at the moment because vast majority of my work has been proprietary and not public. But I'll be filling the space here with some personal projects.
